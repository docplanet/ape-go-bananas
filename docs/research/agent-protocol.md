# Sidecar protocol, part 2: agents

Extends `sidecar-protocol.md` (§1–§3 framing, lifecycle and error rules all
apply unchanged) with the methods the chat needs. Written from
`agent-install-and-auth.md` (how Zed does it), `claude-adapter-auth.md`
(sign-in on the wire), `openrouter-api.md` (the key tier), and
`acp-protocol.md`. Tests under `test/sidecar/agent-*.test.ts` and
`test/agent/` are written from this page by contexts that have not seen
`src/sidecar/agent*.ts`, `src/agents/` or `src/agent/`.

Two kinds of provider sit behind one session surface:

- **ACP agents** — anything in the public ACP registry (Claude, Gemini,
  Codex, …), installed on demand, spoken to through `src/acp`.
- **API providers** — OpenRouter first. The sidecar runs the agent loop
  itself (`src/agent/`), and emits the *same* update stream as an ACP agent.

The app never learns which kind it is talking to after `agent/connect`.

## 1. Provider management: `agents/*`

State lives under a **data directory** the app passes on every call that
needs it (`dataDir`), never a hardcoded path: `<dataDir>/registry.json`
(cache), `<dataDir>/npx/<id>/` (npm installs, one prefix per agent).

### `agents/list`
params `{ dataDir: string, registryUrl?: string, refresh?: boolean }` →
```
{ providers: Provider[], registry: { fetchedAt: string | null, url: string, error: string | null } }
```
`Provider` is
```
{ id: string, kind: "acp" | "api", name: string, description: string,
  version: string | null,           // registry version (acp) or null (api)
  installed: boolean,               // api providers: always true
  installedVersion: string | null,
  distribution: "npx" | "binary" | "uvx" | null,   // acp only
  installable: boolean }            // acp: distribution === "npx" (binary/uvx are listed, not installable yet)
```
- The registry is `GET <registryUrl>` (default
  `https://cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json`),
  cached to `<dataDir>/registry.json` and re-fetched when the cache is
  missing, older than one hour, or `refresh: true`. A fetch failure with a
  cache present uses the cache and reports `error`; with no cache it
  reports `error` and lists only the built-in api providers.
- Registry entries map by `id`, `name`, `description`, `version`, and the
  one key present in `distribution`. Entries lacking `id`/`name`/
  `distribution` are skipped.
- Built-in api providers, always present and always first:
  `{ id: "openrouter", kind: "api", name: "OpenRouter", description: "Any
  model, one API key", version: null, installed: true, installedVersion:
  null, distribution: null, installable: false }`.
- `installedVersion` is read from `<dataDir>/npx/<id>/node_modules/<package>/package.json`.

### `agents/install`
params `{ dataDir, id, npm?: { registry?: string } }` →
`{ id, package: string, version: string, bin: string }`

Runs `npm install --prefix <dataDir>/npx/<id> --save-exact --no-audit --no-fund
<package>@<version>` — the version from the registry entry — using **the
sidecar's own Node** (`process.execPath`) and npm resolved as: env
`APE_NPM_CLI` (path to `npm-cli.js`), else the `npm-cli.js` beside
`process.execPath` (`<dir>/../lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js`), else
`npm` on PATH. `npm.registry` (or env `APE_NPM_REGISTRY`) is passed as
`--registry`. Every stdout/stderr line from npm is forwarded as a
notification `agents/progress { id, stream: "stdout" | "stderr", line }`.
`bin` is the resolved absolute path of the package's `bin` entry (the sole
entry, or the one named after the package's unscoped name), read from the
installed `package.json`. Non-zero npm exit → `-32000` with the last stderr
line in the message. An entry whose distribution is not `npx` → `-32602`.

### `agents/uninstall`
params `{ dataDir, id }` → `{ id, removed: boolean }` — removes
`<dataDir>/npx/<id>` recursively; `false` if it did not exist.

## 2. Sessions: `agent/*`

One **connection** per provider process (or per API key); one **session**
per conversation. Ids are opaque strings minted by the sidecar.

### `agent/connect`
params
```
{ provider: string,                // a Provider.id
  dataDir: string, cwd: string,     // cwd: the course folder
  apiKey?: string,                  // api providers only; never logged, never written
  extraArgs?: string[], env?: Record<string,string> }
```
→
```
{ connectionId: string, provider: string, kind: "acp" | "api",
  agent: { name: string, version: string } | null,
  authStatus: { kind: string, label: string } | null,   // last _auth/status_update seen, or null
  authMethods: AuthMethod[],                            // ACP #5.1 shape, [] for api providers
  session: null | {
    sessionId: string,
    modes: SessionModeState | null,
    configOptions: SessionConfigOption[] | null,
    commands: AvailableCommand[] } ,
  authRequired: boolean }
```
ACP path: resolve `bin` as `agents/install` does (`-32000` "not installed"
if absent), spawn `node <bin> <registry args> <extraArgs>` via
`src/acp`'s `connect()` with `clientCapabilities: { auth: { terminal: true } }`,
then `newSession({ cwd })`. If `newSession` fails with the agent's
auth-required error (`code` -32000 with `data.reason` or message matching
`/auth/i` — record the exact shape the first time a real agent produces it),
return `session: null, authRequired: true` **and keep the connection open**
so `agent/login` can use it. Otherwise pin `setMode('default')` when modes
are present (Handoff: "the one thing that will bite you"), and return the
session.

API path (`openrouter`): `apiKey` required (`-32602`). Validate with
`GET /api/v1/key` (`-32000` on 401 with message `OpenRouter rejected the API
key`). `session.configOptions` is
```
[{ id: "model",  type: "select", name: "Model",  currentValue: <default>, options: [{ value: <model id>, name: "<name> · $<prompt>/M in · $<completion>/M out" }, …] },
 { id: "effort", type: "select", name: "Reasoning effort", currentValue: "medium", options: [{value:"none",name:"None"},{value:"low",name:"Low"},{value:"medium",name:"Medium"},{value:"high",name:"High"}] }]
```
built from `GET /api/v1/models` filtered to models whose
`supported_parameters` includes `tools` and whose `input_modalities`
includes `image`, sorted by name; `<default>` is `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
if listed else the first. `modes` is
`{ currentModeId: "default", availableModes: [{id:"default",name:"Manual",description:"Always ask before writing files"},{id:"acceptEdits",name:"Accept edits",description:"Write files without asking"}] }`.
`commands` is `[]`. The base URL is `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` unless env
`APE_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` overrides it (tests point it at a local fake).

### `agent/login`
params `{ connectionId, methodId }` → `{ methodId, exitCode: number | null, authenticated: boolean }`

- terminal-type method (ACP #5.3): take `client.terminalAuthLaunch(methodId)`,
  spawn it with `stdin` closed, forward each output line as
  `agent/loginOutput { connectionId, stream, line }`, wait for exit. Then
  **reconnect**: close the old connection, spawn afresh with the same
  arguments, `initialize` again, and read the resulting `_auth/status_update`
  (wait up to 3 s for one). `authenticated` is `authStatus.kind !== "none"`.
  The connection keeps its `connectionId`; a following `agent/connect` is not
  required — the response also carries the same `session` object
  `agent/connect` would, created on the new connection.
- agent-type method: `client.authenticate(methodId)`; `exitCode: null`;
  `authenticated: true` if it resolved.
- api providers → `-32602`.

### `agent/status`
params `{ connectionId }` → `{ connectionId, provider, kind, authStatus, authMethods, sessions: string[] }`

### `agent/prompt`
params `{ sessionId, blocks: ContentBlock[] }` — ACP content blocks
(`text`, `image` (base64 + mimeType), `resource_link` (a file path as
`file://` uri, with `mimeType`), `resource` (embedded text)) →
`{ stopReason: "end_turn" | "max_tokens" | "max_turn_requests" | "refusal" | "cancelled" }`.
While the turn runs, every update is a notification
`agent/update { sessionId, update: SessionUpdate }` in ACP's exact shapes
(`agent_message_chunk`, `agent_thought_chunk`, `tool_call`,
`tool_call_update`, `usage_update`, `available_commands_update`,
`current_mode_update`, `config_option_update`). A second `agent/prompt` on a
session mid-turn → `-32000` `"session <id> has a turn in progress"`.

### `agent/cancel`
params `{ sessionId }` → `{}`; the in-flight `agent/prompt` resolves
`"cancelled"`.

### `agent/setMode` `{ sessionId, modeId }` → `{ modes: SessionModeState }`
### `agent/setConfigOption` `{ sessionId, id, value }` → `{ configOptions: SessionConfigOption[] }`
Both pass through to ACP (#17) or update the embedded session's state; an
unknown id/value → `-32602`.

### `agent/disconnect` `{ connectionId }` → `{}` — closes every session and
reaps the process. Also happens for all connections on `sidecar/shutdown`
and EOF.

## 3. Reverse direction: `agent/requestPermission`

The sidecar sends a **request** (with an id) to the app:
```
{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id": <n>, "method": "agent/requestPermission",
  "params": { "sessionId", "toolCall": ToolCallUpdate-shaped, "options": PermissionOption[] } }
```
and the app answers `{ "result": { "outcome": { "outcome": "selected", "optionId" } | { "outcome": "cancelled" } } }`.
Shapes are ACP #14 verbatim. An `error` response or a `cancelled` outcome
denies. For ACP agents this is the agent's own `session/request_permission`
relayed; for the embedded agent it is raised before every `write_file` when
the mode is `default`, with options `allow-once` (`allow_once`),
`allow-always` (`allow_always`, switches the session to `acceptEdits`) and
`reject` (`reject_once`). Ids for reverse requests are minted from a
separate counter and are numbers.

Also forwarded: `agent/authStatus { connectionId, authStatus }` whenever an
ACP agent sends `_auth/status_update`.

## 4. The embedded agent (`src/agent/`, OpenRouter)

A plain loop over `POST /chat/completions` with `stream: true`:

- `messages` = `[system, …history]`. The **system prompt is supplied by the
  caller** on `agent/prompt` as a leading `resource` block with
  `uri: "ape://system"` — the app builds it from the bundled method file;
  the sidecar adds nothing about cards. With no such block the system
  prompt is a one-line identity string.
- `blocks` map: `text` → text part; `image` → `image_url` data URL;
  `resource_link` with `mimeType: application/pdf` → `file` part (base64,
  `plugins: [{ id: "file-parser", pdf: { engine: "native" } }]` when the
  model's `input_modalities` includes `file`, else `mistral-ocr`);
  `resource_link` to an image → `image_url`; `resource_link` to anything
  else → its text, fenced, with the path as a heading.
- `tools`: `read_file { path }`, `write_file { path, content }`, `list_dir
  { path }`, all paths resolved against the session `cwd`; a path escaping
  `cwd` → the tool returns an error string, the loop continues. `write_file`
  raises `agent/requestPermission` first (§3) unless mode is `acceptEdits`.
- `reasoning: { effort }` is sent when the chosen model's
  `supported_parameters` includes `reasoning` and effort ≠ `none`;
  `reasoning_details` from an assistant message are passed back verbatim.
- Streaming: SSE `data:` lines, `: OPENROUTER PROCESSING` comments skipped,
  `[DONE]` ends; `delta.content` → `agent_message_chunk`; `delta.reasoning`
  → `agent_thought_chunk`; `delta.tool_calls[]` accumulated by `index`
  (`id`, `function.name`, `function.arguments` fragments concatenated); a
  chunk carrying `usage` → `usage_update { used: total_tokens, size: <model
  context_length>, _meta: { cost: usage.cost, promptTokens, completionTokens,
  cachedTokens, reasoningTokens } }`; an `error` chunk → the turn ends with
  `-32000` carrying `error.message`.
- Each tool call emits `tool_call { toolCallId, title, kind: "read" | "edit"
  | "search", status: "pending" }` then `tool_call_update { status:
  "completed" | "failed", content: [{type:"content", content:{type:"text", text}}] }`;
  its result goes back as a `role: "tool"` message; the loop re-requests
  until `finish_reason` ≠ `tool_calls`. At most 50 tool rounds per prompt →
  `stopReason: "max_turn_requests"`.
- HTTP 401 → `-32000` `"OpenRouter rejected the API key"`; 402 → `-32000`
  `"OpenRouter: insufficient credits"`; 429 → retry once after 2 s, then
  `-32000`; other non-2xx → `-32000` with `error.message`.
- `agent/cancel` aborts the fetch; the turn resolves `"cancelled"` and the
  partial assistant text is kept in history.

## 5. What the oracles must prove

- `agents/list` with a local fake registry (node:http): built-in first,
  registry entries mapped, cache written, cache used on fetch failure,
  `refresh` re-fetches, malformed entries skipped.
- `agents/install` against a local fake npm registry serving one packument
  + tarball: prefix layout, `bin` resolution, progress notifications carry
  npm's lines, non-npx distribution → `-32602`, failing install → `-32000`.
- `agent/connect` ACP over `test/acp/mock-agent.ts` scenarios: the frame
  sent advertises `auth.terminal`; `setMode('default')` is sent when modes
  exist; `authRequired` path keeps the connection; `agent/prompt` relays
  every update kind as `agent/update`; `agent/requestPermission` round-trips
  the app's answer to the agent; `cancel`; two connections isolated;
  `disconnect` reaps.
- `agent/login` terminal path with a fake login script that prints two
  lines and exits 0: `loginOutput` lines observed in order, reconnect
  happens (the mock sees a second `initialize`), `authenticated` reflects
  the second connection's `_auth/status_update`.
- `agent/connect` for `openrouter` against a local fake (node:http) that
  serves `/key`, `/models`, `/chat/completions` SSE: key rejection, model
  option construction and default, effort option, a text turn, a tool-call
  turn with `read_file`/`write_file`/`list_dir` (write asks permission in
  `default`, does not in `acceptEdits`, deny leaves no file), path escape
  refused, reasoning chunks, usage/cost, error chunk, 402, cancel.
- Nothing in any response or notification contains the API key.
