# A.P.E.

Deck-pipeline structural checks, a `.apkg` (Anki package) writer, a CLI over
both, and an ACP (Agent Client Protocol) client, in TypeScript. Every claim
about what works here is backed by a command in [Status](#status) that was
actually run. Nobody has defined what the letters stand for — none
of this repo's code, comments, or docs do either.

## Requirements

- Node 24.12.0, pinned in `.nvmrc`. A system-default `node` on an older major
  will run the wrong runtime silently; use the pinned version explicitly if
  your shell isn't already picking up `.nvmrc`.
- Zero runtime dependencies. `typescript` and `@types/node` are the only
  devDependencies. Tests run on `node --test`, not a separate framework.

## Build and test

```sh
npm install
npm run build      # tsc: src/**/*.ts -> dist/**/*.js (+ .d.ts)
npm run typecheck  # builds, then tsc --noEmit over src + test together
npm test           # builds, then runs dist-backed tests under node --test
```

## CLI

```sh
npm run build
node dist/cli/index.js <command> [args]      # or: ./dist/cli/index.js ... (executable, shebang)
# or, once installed/linked (package.json's "bin"): ape <command> [args]
```

Three subcommands, each `-h`/`--help`-able on its own. `check` and `review`
mirror `tools/check_deck.py` and `tools/render_review.py` from the engine
repo closely enough that a user of those two scripts should recognize both
immediately; `export` has no Python original — it is this project's own
replacement for the AnkiConnect hand-off step, using `src/apkg` instead.

- **`ape check <deck.json> [--no-media] [--transcript <file>]... [--inventory <file>]`**
  Runs the structural checks (`src/checks`) and prints the exact report
  `check_deck.py` prints, in the same order (`docs/research/check-deck-contract.md`
  §9). Exit codes match the original: `0` clean, `1` the deck has findings
  (or a deck/transcript/inventory failed to load), `2` a usage error or a
  deck that parses but names zero notes.
- **`ape review <deck.json> [-o <out.html>]`**
  Renders one self-contained HTML review page (`src/checks`'
  `renderReview`) — every note's front faces, back, and Extra block. `-o`
  defaults to `review.html` next to `deck.json`, the same default
  `render_review.py` uses.
- **`ape export <deck.json> [-o <out.apkg>] [--deck-name <name>] [--media-dir <dir>]`**
  Writes a real `.apkg` via `src/apkg`'s `writeApkg`. `--deck-name` defaults
  to the deck's own `notes[0].deckName` (every note must share one deckName;
  a multi-deck `deck.json` needs one `export` call per deck — the module
  rejects a mismatch by design, see `src/apkg/collection.ts`). `-o` defaults
  to `<deck>.apkg` next to `deck.json`.

`check` and `review` resolve the Anki media directory the same way the two
Python originals do: the `ANKI_MEDIA` environment variable if set, otherwise
whichever of the two hardcoded per-profile paths exists on disk (the macOS
path is tried first regardless of host OS — a filesystem probe, not a
platform check). `export`'s `--media-dir` uses the same resolution when
omitted.

### The TS-to-test story

Test files live under `test/` as `.ts` and run directly — no `tsx`, no
`ts-node`, no test framework. Node 24 strips TypeScript syntax from a `.ts`
file with no flag needed, and bare `node --test` (no path argument)
auto-discovers any file under a directory named `test/`, so `npm test` is
just that plus a build first.

The one rule this depends on: **test files import runtime code from the
compiled `dist/`, never from `src/` directly.** Source files import each
other with `.js`-extensioned specifiers, per NodeNext module resolution, so
that `tsc` emits a `dist/` that runs standalone as plain JavaScript — that
compiled output is the actual product, not a side effect of testing.

Running a `src/*.ts` file raw, instead, hits those same `.js` specifiers
before there's any compiled `.js` for Node to find. Confirmed by hand: a
`.ts` file that imports a sibling via `./sibling.js` cannot be run directly
when only `sibling.ts` exists on disk — Node does not fall back from `.js` to
`.ts`, it throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Importing from `dist/` instead
sidesteps this entirely, because there the specifier and the on-disk file are
both genuinely `.js`.

Concretely, in a test file:

```ts
import { checkNote } from '../dist/checks/foo.js';  // runtime value: from dist
import type { Finding } from '../dist/types.js';    // type only: also from dist,
                                                      // resolved via dist/types.d.ts
```

Type-only imports need the `type` keyword. Node's stripping works one file at
a time with no cross-file knowledge of what's a type versus a value — an
import written without `type` is left as a real runtime import, and if the
name is actually type-only (as everything in `src/types.ts` is), that import
has no matching runtime export and throws at test time. Always write `import
type` for anything that's only ever a type.

Because tests resolve against `dist/` (gitignored, so a fresh clone starts
without it), both `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` build first — already
wired into both scripts, nothing extra to run by hand.

The one exception: a `.ts` helper that only other test files import (nothing
under `src/` needs it) can use an explicit `.ts` specifier instead —
`tsconfig.test.json` turns on `allowImportingTsExtensions` for exactly that
case, and it resolves fine at runtime because the specifier and the on-disk
file agree there too.

## Layout

- `src/types.ts` — the shared contract: the AnkiConnect-shaped note
  (`DeckNote`, `NoteFields`) and the structural-check result (`Finding`).
  Deliberately minimal — nothing module-specific lives here.
- `src/checks/` — port of the Python deck checker's structural checks.
- `src/apkg/` — `.apkg` writer.
- `src/acp/` — Agent Client Protocol client: JSON-RPC over stdio, session
  lifecycle, streamed prompt turns, cancellation, and permission requests
  routed through a caller-supplied policy. Tested against a mock agent only
  — no live agent handshake yet, see [Status](#status).
- `src/cli/` — the `ape` CLI: argv parsing and exit codes wired onto
  `src/checks` and `src/apkg` (see [CLI](#cli) above). Owns deck.json
  loading/validation (`deck-loader.ts`) and Anki-media-directory resolution
  (`media-dir.ts`) — neither `src/checks` nor `src/apkg` does this itself,
  since both treat `DeckNote[]` as already-validated input.
- `test/integration/` — drives the built CLI as a real child process
  (never `checkDeck`/`renderReview`/`writeApkg` called directly) through
  the full check → review → export pipeline on the seven reference cards,
  then reopens the produced `.apkg` with the system `unzip` and
  `node:sqlite` — tools sharing no code with this repo. A second file
  covers CLI-boundary argument/exit-code behavior the golden path doesn't
  (usage errors, a dirty deck, a missing file, `--inventory`/`--transcript`
  wiring).
- `test/fixtures/reference-cards.json` — the seven canonical reference cards
  (`ref-01`..`ref-07`) that define the card style, copied verbatim from their
  source (see `docs/research/check-deck-contract.md` for exactly where and
  the full rationale). Any check or renderer this repo ships must pass all
  seven before its verdict is trusted: a check that rejects one of these, or
  accepts something one of these would reject, is what's wrong, not the
  fixture. `test/scaffold.test.ts` pins the fixture's exact text against that
  source so an edit can't silently drift it.
- `docs/research/` — implementer's-reference notes written before this code:
  the ACP v1 wire protocol, the `.apkg` file format, and the behavioral
  contracts of the two Python tools being ported. Read the one that matches
  before touching a given module.
- `docs/STATUS.md` — per-module: what works, what is stubbed, what the next
  concrete step is. The detail behind the summary below.

## Status

Everything claimed here was checked by actually running the command named,
not by reading the code and assuming — see `docs/STATUS.md` for the same
picture broken out per module.

**`src/checks` and `src/apkg` are solid.** Both have exhaustive suites:
`src/checks`' differential tests run the real `python3 tools/check_deck.py`
and `tools/render_review.py` in the engine repo and diff output
byte-for-byte; `src/apkg`'s tests reopen every `.apkg` they write with the
system `unzip` and `node:sqlite`, tools sharing no code with the writer
itself. All green.

**`src/cli` (this integration pass) works end-to-end against the reference
fixture.** `test/integration/pipeline.test.ts` spawns the real, built
`dist/cli/index.js` — never the underlying functions directly — through
`check` (clean) → `review` (writes real HTML) → `export` (writes a real
`.apkg`), then reopens that `.apkg` independently and checks its note count,
card count, deck name, notetype, and every field's round-tripped content.
`test/integration/cli-errors.test.ts` covers the CLI-boundary behavior the
golden path doesn't: usage errors, a missing file, malformed JSON, a note
missing `fields.Text`, a deck naming zero notes, a genuinely dirty note,
`--inventory`/`--transcript` wiring, and an `--deck-name` mismatch. Also
exercised by hand beyond what's automated, including the media-directory
default-resolution fallback.

**What has not been verified, by anyone, at any point:**

- **Anki import: now verified** (this bullet previously said it was not).
  `test/apkg/anki-import.test.ts` imports an exported package into a
  disposable Anki 26.5 collection and asserts 7 notes / 14 cards with the
  expected cloze ordinals. It was written after that exact check found that
  every package this repo produced was rejected by Anki — see
  [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md). It skips, loudly, where Anki is absent.
  **AnkiConnect sync is still unverified**, and no live tier is built.
- **Real agents: handshake proven, prompt turn not.** Live smoke tests
  against `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` 0.75.1 and Gemini CLI
  0.40.1 confirm `initialize`, protocol negotiation, `session/new`, streamed
  updates and clean shutdown on the wire. No prompt turn has completed —
  both credentials are currently expired — so `end_turn`, live tool calls,
  live permission requests and cancellation remain mock-only. Live runs
  surfaced three defects a mock structurally cannot produce; see
  [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md).
- **Sign-in is the agent CLI's job, not A.P.E.'s.** The Claude adapter
  returns `authMethods: []` and handles auth out-of-band, so ACP
  `authenticate` will not unblock Claude Code — log in with the `claude`
  CLI. Gemini CLI does advertise auth methods, which is where an
  `authenticate` implementation matters.
- **`npm test` used to lie here.** The script called bare `node`, and on
  Node 20 the test runner does not discover `.ts` files — it reported
  `0 tests, 0 fail` and exited 0. A `pretest` guard now refuses to run below
  Node 24 and explains why. If you see a suspiciously fast green, check
  `node --version` first.

Given a `deck.json` shaped like `test/fixtures/reference-cards.json`, a user
can check it, render a review page for it, and export an `.apkg` that real
Anki imports — all three verified by running them, the last against a
disposable Anki 26.5 collection. What they cannot yet do through this repo
is drive an actual ACP coding agent: `src/acp/` is empty, and the tests
waiting for it are red on purpose.
