// Assembling a `.apkg`, with nothing platform-specific in it.
//
// SQLite, media reads and compression all arrive as arguments (sqlite.ts,
// media.ts, zip.ts), so this module -- the package's actual shape -- imports
// no node: anything and runs unchanged in a browser. index.ts supplies the
// Node implementations and writes the result to a file; a browser supplies
// sql.js and fflate and hands the bytes to a download.
//
// See docs/research/apkg-format.md §1 for why this writes exactly
// collection.anki21 + media (+ numbered media files) and nothing else -- no
// `meta` member, no legacy collection.anki2 stub.

 * the referenced media files, deflate/store zipped per docs/research/apkg-format.md.
 *
 * A plain (non-`async`) function: every step here -- SQLite writes, media
 * reads, deflate, the final file write -- is synchronous, so an `async`
 * signature would only have claimed to yield the event loop without ever
 * doing so. `await writeApkg(...)` still works at every call site (`await`
 * on a non-Promise value resolves to that value immediately).
 *
 * Validates its own inputs before doing any work, rather than letting a
 * malformed note or a bad clock surface as a raw TypeError/RangeError from
 * deep inside collection.ts/ids.ts with no indication of which note or
 * option was at fault -- deck.json (the usual source of `notes`) is
 * LLM-authored, not a trusted, statically-typed value, so the declared
 * DeckNote[]/WriteApkgOptions types are a contract this function checks
 * rather than one it's entitled to assume.
