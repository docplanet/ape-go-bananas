// What the agent is told about the steps, and how it answers back.
//
// The writer only ever saw the step it was prompted with. A note sent in
// the chat mid-extract got "I already extracted it" and an offer to run the
// rest of the process its own way, not the method's. So every chat message
// and every stage prompt carries this note: the eight steps as the rail shows
// them, which is running, and what the agent may do about them.
//
// It answers with a line of its own at the end of a reply -- "APE: done
// extract", "APE: run organize" -- which the app checks against the folder
// before acting. A line of text rather than a tool, so it works the same for
// every agent, the embedded OpenRouter loop included. No imports but types,
// so the tests run it as it is.
